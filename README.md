This project is composed of two parts: CRD-EMKD and SSKD-EMKD. Our project is based on [CRD](https://github.com/HobbitLong/RepDistiller) and [SSKD](https://github.com/xuguodong03/SSKD).

## USE CRD-EMKD and other methods
Go to the subdirectory [`CRD-EMKD`], if you want to use distillation methods like CRD, CRD+MC, CRD+MC+BCS (i.e. CRD+EMKD). More distillation methods (like KD, FitNet, AT, SP, CC, VID, RKD, PKT, AB, FT, FSP, NST) can also be found in this subdirectory.

## USE SSKD-EMKD
Go to the subdirectory [`SSKD-EMKD`], if you want to use distillation methods like SSKD, SSKD+MC, SSKD+MC+BCS (i.e. SSKD+EMKD).

## More instructions
More detailed instructions can be seen in README in these subdirectories respectively.
